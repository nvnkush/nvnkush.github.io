As a dynamic professional, I hold a doctoral degree in Chemical Engineering and have amassed over 7 years of 
extensive research experience focused on fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and particles flow dynamics. Currently, I 
serve as a Senior Process Engineer at Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, where I utilize my expertise to tackle challenges 
related to fluid flow, process development, scale-up, and design. My work revolves around the application of 
Chemical Engineering principles, as well as Computational and Mathematical Modeling.
